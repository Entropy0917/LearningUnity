# LearningUnity
## This is an example unfinished game that I used to learn Unity. Still a work in progress. <br>
## The game is a recreartion of the popular game Flappy Bird using the Unity engine.

This was my first project in Unity. If you are intrested in starting in Unity, here are a few links to get you set up:
* [Unity](https://unity.com/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Feel free to checkout and use this as an example. I am just a begginer and this was fun and educational. I hope you can find some value in starting too. ðŸ¤“
